# Local variables:
- Recall Local variables are bounded by a function / local scope.
- One finished, the variable is destroyed 
# Global variables:
- Global variables are defined outside of all the functions
- Visibile
# Static variables:
-The space for the static variable is allocated only one time and this is used for the entirety of the program
# Notes:
- Global and static variables are initialized to their default values, Which is zero
- nullptr for pointers 
- A global variable is visible from its point of declaration to end of file
- Donâ€™t access it before that
#### In practice: using static local variables or global variables = not welcomed
